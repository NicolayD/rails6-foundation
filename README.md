# Rails 6 with Foundation

This is sample Rails 6 app with Foundation.
I used it to find out the steps needed to add Foundation to a Rails 6 project with webpack.

Credit to [this Reddit discussion and u/bashuser](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/bhk72q/how_to_require_foundationsites_after_yarn_add/) and [this GitHub comment](https://github.com/foundation/foundation-sites/issues/7879#issuecomment-171868338) that showed me I need to add `@include foundation-everything`.

Shoutout to [this helpful comment](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/2059#issuecomment-486491924), too.
